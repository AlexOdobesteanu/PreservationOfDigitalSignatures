##LTP of Digital Signatures Service
The project aimed to detail the implementation of a long-term preservation service for qualified electronic signatures, that is in accordance with the legislative context provided by the ETSI TS 119 511, ETSI TS 119 512 standards. The main languages and technologies used in the development process were Java (Spring Boot Framework), the Digital Signature Service library and SQL Server. Authentication and authorization was implemented via JWT. The solution also has a document monitoring system, which ensures that documents remain valid for long periods of time, even if technological progress is rapid. The system notifies users if alert thresholds are exceeded. The solution also contains a public component of the Ethereum Blockchain, in which the metadata of the documents is stored and which ensures the transparency and immutability of the preservation process.
